**Kanban Board**

I'm using Notion to track progress on features and tasks for this project. Here is an embedded view of the kanban board:

[Tasker Kanban Board](https://vdloc.notion.site/5b937e90fc664e44aca154d980038940?v=5efc294ae8a7485fab0f40d3775ac3d3&pvs=4)

The kanban board includes:

- Backlog - Prioritized list of tasks to complete
- In Progress - Tasks currently being worked on
- Halted - Tasks paused or delayed for some reason
- Discarded - Tasks removed from scope or cancelled 
- Done - Completed tasks and features

Let me know if you have any questions! I'm open to suggestions on better ways to manage project tasks as well.
